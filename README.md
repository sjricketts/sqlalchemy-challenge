## SQL Data Engineering and Analysis of Employee Records
*Visualizations of employee salary ranges and average salary per department*
Created ERD of six .csv files using QuickDBD to engineer SQL table schema specifying data types, primary keys, and secondary keys. Imported data into PostgreSQL to analyze employment records, including hire dates, department names, and salary information. Leveraged SQLAlchemy to import SQL database into Python where data tables were read into Pandas dataframe and merged into a single dataframe. Created histogram of salary ranges and bar chart of average salary for each department using Matplotlib. 
Tools used: PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, QuickDBD (used to create ERD)
